- Transition can also provide animations.
- Transition can be used for clear and simple cases like A state -> B state
  - For example, hover, transform, rotate, scale, color-change, etc.
- If the animation want to implement can be done with transition, use it directly
- When transition cannot implement, use keyframes instead
  - Things only possible with keyframes: multi-step animations, auto-execution/repetition, pause animations, alternating, delayed start
